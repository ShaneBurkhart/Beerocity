      %p.info HomeBrewster makes it easy for you to brew and try all kinds of beer! Every month we will send you the ingredients for a new recipe to brew. You no longer need waste time searching for unique and seasonal recipes. We do that for you!

      %p.info We understand that all grain brewing gives you more control, and creates an all around better beer.  Because of this, our kits are completely all grain brew kits.

      %p.info Currently we only offer kits for five gallon batches.  Most people tend to brew around this much per batch.  If you would like a bigger or smaller kit, contact us and we will see what we can do.
