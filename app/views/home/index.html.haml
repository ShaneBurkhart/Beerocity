      %p.info Every month we will send you the ingredients for a new recipe to brew. You no longer need waste time searching for unique and seasonal recipes. We do that for you!

      %p.info We understand that all grain brewing gives you more control or your beer's taste, and creates an all around better beer.  Because of this, all of our kits are completely all grain brew kits.

      %p.info Currently we only offer kits for five gallon batches.  Most people tend to brew around this much per batch.  If you would like a bigger or smaller kit, contact us and we will see what we can do.
